\begin{frame}{Explicit finite-difference method for the heat equation}

\noindent
Consider the heat (diffusion) equation
\begin{equation}
u_{t} = K \, u_{xx}, \quad
0<x< L, \quad 0 < t < T,   \label{a1}
\end{equation}
subject to the boundary conditions
\begin{equation}
u(0, t) = u(L, t)=0 \quad \hbox{for} \quad t\in (0,T),   \label{a2}
\end{equation}
and initial condition
\begin{equation}
u(x, 0) = u_{0}(x),   \label{a3}
\end{equation}
where $u_{0}(x)$ is a given function. In Eq. (\ref{a1}), $K>0$.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Grid points (or mesh points)}

Let $N,M\in\mathbb{N}$ and let
\[
\tau=\frac{T}{M}, \quad h=\frac{L}{N}.
\]
Then we define the grid points $(x_{k}, t_{j})$:
\begin{eqnarray}
&&x_{k}=hk \quad {\rm for} \quad k=0,1,\dots,N; \nonumber \\
&&t_{j}=\tau j \quad {\rm for} \quad j=0,1,\dots,M. \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
The problem is to find numbers $w_{kj}$
such that $w_{kj}$ approximates the value of the exact solution
$u(x,t)$ at the grid point $(x_{k}, t_{j})$, i.e.
\[
w_{kj}\approx u(x_{k}, t_{j})
\]
for $k=0,1,\dots,N$ and $j=0,1,2,\dots$

\begin{frame}{Approximations to partial derivatives}

By definition,
\[
u_{t}(x_k,t_j)=\lim_{\tau\to 0}\frac{u(x_k,t_j+\tau)-u(x_k,t_j)}{\tau}.
\]
It is natural to expect that
\[
u_{t}(x_k,t_j)\approx \frac{u(x_k,t_j+\tau)-u(x_k,t_j)}{\tau}
\]
for sufficiently small $\tau$.

\vskip 5mm
\textcolor{blue}{What is the error of this formula?}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}{Truncation error}

The first Taylor polynomial for $u(x_k,t_j+\tau)$:
\[
u(x_k,t_j+\tau)=u(x_k,t_j)+\tau \frac{\pr u}{\pr t}(x_k,t_j)+
\frac{\tau^2}{2}\frac{\pr^2 u}{\pr t^2}(x_k,\xi)
\]
where $\xi$ is between $t_j$ and $t_j+\tau$. Therefore,
\[
\tau_{kj}=\frac{\pr u}{\pr t}(x_k,t_j)-\frac{u(x_k,t_j+\tau)-u(x_k,t_j)}{\tau}=
-\frac{\tau}{2}\frac{\pr^2 u}{\pr t^2}(x_k,\xi).
\]
$\tau_{kj}$ is called the \textcolor{blue}{{\em truncation error }}.

\vskip 5mm
If $u_{tt}(x,t)$ is bounded, then
\[
\tau_{kj}=O(\tau) \quad {\rm as} \quad \tau\to 0.
\]

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}{Forward- and backward-difference formulae}
Formula
\[
u_{t}(x_k,t_j)\approx \frac{u(x_k,t_j+\tau)-u(x_k,t_j)}{\tau}
\]
for $\tau>0$ is called the {\bf forward-difference formula}.

\vskip 5mm
If we replace $\tau$ by $-\tau$, we obtain
the {\bf backward-difference formula}:
\[
u_{t}(x_k,t_j)\approx \frac{u(x_k,t_j)-u(x_k,t_j-\tau)}{\tau}.
\]


\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}{Finite difference formula for $u_{xx}$}

From Taylor's theorem,
\begin{eqnarray}
u(x_k+h,t_j)&=&u(x_k,t_j)+h u_{x}(x_k,t_j)+
\frac{h^2}{2}u_{xx}(x_k,t_j) \nonumber \\
&&+
\frac{h^3}{6}u_{xxx}(x_k,t_{j})+
\frac{h^4}{24}u_{xxxx}(\xi_1,t_{j}), \nonumber \\
u(x_k-h,t_j)&=&u(x_k,t_j)-h u_{x}(x_k,t_j)+
\frac{h^2}{2}u_{xx}(x_k,t_j) \nonumber \\
&&-
\frac{h^3}{6}u_{xxx}(x_k,t_{j})+
\frac{h^4}{24}u_{xxxx}(\xi_2,t_{j}) \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
for some $\xi_{1}$ between $x_{k}$ and $x_{k}+h$
and some $\xi_{2}$ between $x_{k}-h$ and $x_{k}$.

Now take the sum of these.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}{}
The sum of these yields
\begin{eqnarray}
u(x_k+h,t_j)+u(x_k-h,t_j)&=&2u(x_k,t_j)+ h^2u_{xx}(x_k,t_j) \nonumber \\
&&+ \frac{h^4}{24}\left[u_{xxxx}(\xi_1,t_{j}) +
u_{xxxx}(\xi_2,t_{j})\right].  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
The number
\[
\frac{1}{2}\left[u_{xxxx}(\xi_{1}, t_{j})+u_{xxxx}(\xi_{2},t_{j})\right]
\]
is between
\[
u_{xxxx}(\xi_{1},t_{j}) \quad {\rm and} \quad u_{xxxx}(\xi_{2},t_{j}).
\]
If $u_{xxxx}$ is continuous, then
by the intermediate value theorem,
\[
\frac{1}{2}\left[u_{xxxx}(\xi_{1},t_{j})+u_{xxxx}(\xi_{2},t_{j})\right]
=u_{xxxx}(\xi,t_{j}).
\]
for some $\xi$ between $\xi_{1}$ and $\xi_{2}$.





\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}{}
Hence,
\[
u_{xx}(x_k,t_j)=\frac{u(x_{k+1},t_j)-2u(x_k,t_j)+u(x_{k-1},t_j)}{h^2}
-\frac{h^2}{12}u_{xxxx}(\xi,t_{j}),
\]
where $\xi\in(x_{k-1},x_{k+1})$.

This is called the {\bf central difference formula} for $u_{xx}$.
If $u_{xxxx}$ is bounded, the truncation error is $O(h^2)$


\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Forward-difference method for the heat eqn.}

Let
\[
w_{kj}\approx u(x_{k},t_{j}).
\]
Then
\[
\frac{w_{k,j+1}-w_{kj}}{\tau}-K
\frac{w_{k+1, j}-2w_{kj}+w_{k-1,j}}{h^{2}}=0,
\]
for each interior grid point. Local truncation error is $O(\tau)$+$O(h^2)$.

{\bf Boundary conditions:}
\[

\item We have
\[
\tilde{\bf w}^{(1)}=A\tilde{\bf w}^{(0)}=A\left({\bf w}^{(0)}+{\bf z}^{(0)}\right)=A{\bf w}^{(0)}+A{\bf z}^{(0)},
\]
i.e.
\[
{\bf z}^{(1)}=\tilde{\bf w}^{(1)}-{\bf w}^{(1)}=A{\bf z}^{(0)}.

\item At the $n$-th time step,
\[
{\bf z}^{(n)}=\tilde{\bf w}^{(n)}-{\bf w}^{(n)}=A^n{\bf z}^{(0)}.
\]
\item The method is stable if
for any initial error ${\bf z}^{(0)}$,
\[
\Vert A{\bf z}^{(0)}\Vert\leq \Vert {\bf z}^{(0)}\Vert
\]
Here $\Vert\cdot\Vert$ is any vector norm.

\item This is
equivalent to
\[
\vert\lambda_{i}\vert\leq 1 \quad \hbox{for} \quad i=1, 2, \dots, N-1,
